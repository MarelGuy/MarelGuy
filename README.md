- ## About me
	- ### Who am I?

		- Hi! my name is Loris, I'm 17 years old, and I'm an Italian MERN-Stack developer graduated at [Strive School](https://strive.school/ "Strive School"). I mosly prefeer backend, but frontend is one of my passions even if I'm not that good at it. Right now my journey on web development is currently on hiatus due to a passion I recently discovered: Rust and programming languages.
		I'm usually a pretty good learner, especially if the logic of the argument matches my logic (programming is my favourite topic!).

	- ### What am I doing right now?
		- Right now I'm currently studying the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org "the Rust programming language") programming language along by creating a programming language called Jay! At the time of the writing of this document, it is still on very early stages;
		- I'm trying to obtain a certification in the English langauge, as you might read, I do speak English pretty fluently, but I guess that this alone won't get me somewhere;
		- Playing Videogames! I really love the whole gaming scene, both single and multi player, working in the gaming industry would really be one of my ambitions someday!
		- Studying for highschool. As you might have read before, I'm 17 years old, and I sadly need to study in highschool till I'm 19 years old (At least here in italy).

	- ### What do i like?
		 - Lists!
		 - Everything that concerns the computer world! From kernels to videgames;
		 - Music: I love listening to Post-rock, Argent Metal, '80s JPOP and more;
		 - Animals! I also have an adorable cat;
		 - Videogames: League of Legends is on the first place, it is chill sometimes.

	- ### What are my pros?
		- Honesty: I don't mind admitting errors or telling someone something;
		- Hard working: if there's a goal to reach, and I'm struggling with it, I WILL strive to reach it, no matter what;
		- Flexibility: I can be really flexible with the tools if the project requests it;
		- Team worker: I try my best to work as much as possible with the team members troughout the whole project.

	- ### What are my cons?
		- Honesty: I may a little bit too honest sometimes;
		- Off topic: If I'm bored, I tend to go off topic on some things;
		- Bad immagination: I tend to follow other people's style, somehow, I can't come up with good ones.
